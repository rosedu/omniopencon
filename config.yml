Will start first with an overview of how the development process scales for a project with more than 30 millions lines of code which sees around 10.000 patches and more than 2.000 developers working on each release. We will then walk the roadmap of sending a contribution to the Linux kernel from identifying the first line to change, discovering the right tools and then navigating the path until the patch gets merged by Linus Torvalds into mainline tree."

Thorsten's a computer scientist by education, and a Free Software enthusiast by heart, a geek from early childhood - and someone who was lucky enough to turn a hobby into an occupation. After first working for Sun Microsystems on then-OpenOffice.org, he then went with a number of others founding The Document Foundation and the LibreOffice project. These days, his day job includes substantial amounts of project management and customer interactions, which does not prevent him from still messing with LibreOffice code. He's recently spun up his own company allotropia to have even more fun with open source all day!"

      description: "The world of software development is generally associated with technical skills specific to computer science and engineering. It requires a set of fundamentals that social scientists usually do not possess, their use of software being limited to either using GUIs or at best using adapted script files. The current talk describes the road from zero knowledge in programming to a current collection of useful software, using an array of languages such as R, C, Javascript / Typescript and integration frameworks like Electron under Node.js, to create user friendly user interfaces for data collection and analysis."

      description: "Teachers often complain about doing boring and repetitive tasks related to infrastructure, grading, missing or misplaced teaching materials. Automation and availability of resources mitigate the aforementioned issues to a great extent. Because the open-source paradigm inherently makes use of these principles, we are proposing a methodology for organising open-source courses. We then showcase examples of such courses taught at UPB, which feature a high degree automation regarding grading, as well as completely public and constant availability of teaching resources."

Inside a data center, between data centers, or to and from edge and mobile devices. So this talk is about moving bytes. How to establish a connection so that bytes can move at all, how to upgrade to a direct connection to make sure the bytes are moving quickly, and how to use cryptography to make sure you are moving the right bytes. I will describe the tailscale approach for establishing direct connections, and how we have adapted this to QUIC connections in the iroh-net rust crate. I will also describe how the BLAKE3 hash function enables verified streaming and range requests, and how our iroh-blobs library allows you to use this in demanding use cases. You will leave this talk with knowledge how to establish direct QUIC connections even behind NAT via hole punching, how to use BLAKE3 verified streaming, and hopefully also the desire to try this out."

With features inspired by state of the art high-level languages such as Python, Java and Rust, but enabling C/C++-like performance, D is a jack of all trades. Do you want to prototype something rapidly and not care about memory allocations? You can just use the garbage collector and the standard library. Do you now want to evolve your prototype into an end product where performance is important? You can just opt-out of using the GC and use your custom allocation scheme (provided that one of the standard library allocators does not suit you). Is memory safety an issue? You can just enable compile time memory safety checks. Whatever your use case, D has an answer. Not to mention D’s metaprogramming capabilities, which are unmatched in any other language. In this talk, I will present some of D’s cool features and how they apply to specific use cases."

In the design of Congame, a platform for running such economic studies, we decided to use delimited continuations to manage the common flow of participants through a study. In this talk, I'll go over some of the benefits of using continuations in a web context as well as cover some of the pitfalls"

Teachers can use modern software solutions to offload tasks to infrastructures which can automate the tasks that they would usually do by hand. We have developed the vmchecker framework which connects to the Moodle e-learning platform and runs assignment tests using the CI/CD suite found in the GitLab platform to connect students to real-life development practices such as running applications in containers, running in CI/CD applications, while reducing teachers workloads."
