<p itemprop="description">
OmniOpenCon is a gathering of people, projects and communities involved in all things open: open source, open data, open science, open hardware, open education.
We value openness, freedom and sharing and we want to bring together all who share these beliefs.
</p>

<p>
OmniOpenCon is free as in free speech and as in free beer:
everyone is welcome to attend for free, and all information and resources are publicly available.
We follow the example and the spirit of <a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a>.
</p>

<p>
The 3 day event consists of a conference-proper (talks) in the first day, workshops in the second day and hackathons in the third day.
We welcome everyone to attend, either as a speaker, workshop organizer or participant.
See you soon!
