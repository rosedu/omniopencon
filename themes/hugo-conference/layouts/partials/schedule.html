<h4 class="section-title">Day 3: Hackathon (Saturday, September 28, 2024)</h4>

<p>
We will have a full day to do hacking on our own project on Saturday, September 28, 2024, 10:00-18:00.
During the hackathon day, members of participating communities and project will use the time to work close to each other on current items.
</p>

<p>We will provide pizza for lunch üçï </p>

<p>
<strong>Please bring your laptop.</strong>
</p>

<p>
This is a good time for project leaders to welcome and train newcomers.
And, of course, for newcomers to get involved and make their first (of hopefully many more) contribution.
</p>

<p>
The format is very open.
We will provide hacking spaces where each project can work.
Tell people about your project, invite them to contribute, work on your own items and / or assist others with their work.
</p>

<p>
We'll have a short summary presentation at the end (17:30) where each project and community tells about their results after a hard day at work.
</p>
